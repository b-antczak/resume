# Resume

My personal resume written with pure HTML/CSS.

## Styling
Use a single font for simplicity and professionalism (of course this is open to debate depending on the given field; I personally elect to use a single font): [STIX Two Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/STIX+Two+Text).

Define categories of text in the document and showcase them based on size and colour, the primary colour being *rgba(0, 0, 0)*:

- **Name:** 48px size, 75% opacity.

- **Headers:** 20px size, only text that uses secondary colour.

- **Subheaders and links** 13px size, 75% opacity.

- **Bullet points and lists:** 13px size, 64% opacity.
